sbatch: Single-node jobs run on a shared node by default. Add --exclusive if you want to use a node exclusively.
sbatch: A full node consists of 192 CPU cores, 344064 MiB of memory and 0 GPUs and can be shared by up to 12 jobs.
sbatch: By default shared jobs get 1792 MiB of memory per CPU core, unless explicitly overridden with --mem-per-cpu, --mem-per-gpu or --mem.
